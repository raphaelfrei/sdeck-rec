## 📁 FFMPEG Binary

Place your `ffmpeg.exe` file in the following folder:

````/libs/ffmpeg.exe````

### ⚠️ Important:

- The version I've used is available under the **[Releases](../../releases)** section of this repository.
- GitHub does **not** allow binary files larger than **25MB** in the repository itself, which is why it's not included directly here.

> 🛠️ Make sure to download the correct version of `ffmpeg.exe` and place it in the `/libs/` folder before running the application.
